The required documents for higher education depend on the institution and program to which you are applying. Generally, you will need transcripts of your previous education as well as an undergraduate degree certification. Many institutions will also require a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an application form. Medical certificates are also usually required, but Riaz Khan's information did not specify whether this was needed for higher education.
